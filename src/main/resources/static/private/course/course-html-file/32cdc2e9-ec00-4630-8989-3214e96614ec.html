        <p>ABSTRACT: E-learning is considered as a better learning that provides technology assistance to support learning. While elearning gives more flexibility toward learning, the creation of e-learning content needs more attention. The purpose of the paper is to provide project management plan based on Project Management Body of Knowledge or PMBOK in short, to the creation of e-learning content. The creation of something that produces product, service or result is considered as a project. In other words, the e-learning content creation is one of the definitive project. However, 71% of the projects were failed or challenged and one of the top reasons why project failed is bad estimates of planning in the project. Even more challenging, elearning project suffers more than the failure rate of information system. Just having a plan and poor planning may lead to failed project. Nevertheless, the e-learning project needs project management plan. Rather than as a methodology of the research, the project management plan can be considered as a guide to carry out the work in the project. The study found that the project management plan consists of scope, time, cost and quality. This research will be useful for those who concerned in creating project management plan. Mostly of project plans are based on scope, time, and schedule. But it remains to be seen whether the product has met the customer or owner expectation. Thus solution to the e-learning project failure lies in creating project management plan which includes scope, schedule, cost, and quality.
